# Data structures

This repo contains rust exercises about data structures and algorithms. It aims to be used as a small course about data structures and a rust training project.

Exercises come from the next course:Â (https://www.udemy.com/course/js-algorithms-and-data-structures-masterclass) but are implemented in rust.

To have an overview of the repo, run `cargo doc --open`
