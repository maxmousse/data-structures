# Problem solving methodology

- Understand the problem

  - Can I restate the problem with my own words
  - What are the inputs that go into the problem
  - What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem
  - Do I have enough info to solve the problem (can outputs be deduced from inputs)
  - Put names/label on the data that are part of the problem

- Explore concrete examples

  - Start with simple examples
  - Progress to more complex examples
  - Explore examples with empty inputs
  - Explore examples with invalid inputs

- Break it down

  - Write steps as comments (helps to think, and share thought process with interviewers)

- Solve/simplify

  - Try to solve the problem
  - If there is some blocking points, simplify it, or delay their treatment
  - Better to write something than nothing and come back later

- Look back and refactor
  - Can you check the result
  - Can you derive the result differently
  - Can you understand it at a glance
  - Can you use the result or method for some other problem
  - Can you improve the performance of your solution
  - Can you think of other ways to refactor
  - How have other people solved this problem
