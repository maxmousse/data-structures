//! Graphs are abstract data structures that consist of nodes (vertices)
//! and edges connecting pairs of nodes. These connections can represent various
//! relationships, such as friendships in a social network or dependencies
//! between tasks in project management. Graphs are versatile and find
//! applications in a wide range of fields. They can be used to model and
//! analyze complex systems, including social networks, transportation networks,
//! and computer networks. Graph algorithms help uncover patterns,
//! optimize routes, and identify critical nodes. Additionally, graphs are
//! foundational in the field of computer science for solving problems like
//! pathfinding, network flow, and resource allocation. Their ability to represent
//! intricate relationships and dependencies makes them a fundamental tool for
//! solving real-world problems across diverse domains.
