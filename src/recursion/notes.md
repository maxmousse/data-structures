# Recursion

Definition: A process that calls itself (usually a function).

Use cases:

- JSON parse / JSON stringify (js), written recursively as it explores nested structure
- Tree / graph traversal (DOM)
- Can sometimes be a cleaner alternative to iteration

How does it works:

- Recursive function call itself repetitively with a different input
- It stops when it reaches 'The base case' (the end condition)
