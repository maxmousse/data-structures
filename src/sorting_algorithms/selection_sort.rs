/// Sort using selection sort algorithm
///
/// ##Â Principle
///
/// The algorithm divides the input list into two parts:
/// a sorted sublist of items which is built up from left
/// to right at the front (left) of the list and a sublist
/// of the remaining unsorted items that occupy the rest of
/// the list. Initially, the sorted sublist is empty and
/// the unsorted sublist is the entire input list.
/// The algorithm proceeds by finding the smallest
/// (or largest, depending on sorting order) element in the
/// unsorted sublist, exchanging (swapping) it with the
/// leftmost unsorted element (putting it in sorted order),
/// and moving the sublist boundaries one element to the right.
///
/// ## Performances
///
/// Selection sort algorithm has an O(n2) time complexity,
/// which makes it inefficient on large lists, and generally
/// performs worse than the similar insertion sort.
/// Selection sort is noted for its simplicity and
/// has performance advantages over more complicated
/// algorithms in certain situations, particularly
/// where auxiliary memory is limited.
